Aspiring cybersecurity professional pursuing a Master's Degree, blending technical expertise with a strong legal foundation. Dedicated to lifelong learning, with a focus on continuously working on and refining my skills.



With hands-on experience in protecting systems, simulating attacks, building and configuring computers, and assessing security risks from both technical and legal perspectives, I possess a comprehensive skillset that I'm now eager to apply in real-world settings and further refine through practical experience.


I'm excited to share some of the projects I've been working on. Feel free to explore and provide feedback!
